# This file can be used to define environment variables for local development.
# However, for sensitive keys like API keys, it's best practice to use a .env.local file,
# which is typically gitignored.
#
# For production, these variables MUST be set in your Firebase App Hosting environment configuration.

# --- Firebase Client SDK Configuration (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side access) ---
# Already covered by NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* variables you set up for Firebase client SDK.

# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_signing_secret_here

# --- Google AI (Gemini) API Key for Genkit (Server-Side) ---
# Genkit's googleAI() plugin will automatically look for this.
# For local development, place your actual key in a .env.local file (e.g., GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...).
# For production, set this in your Firebase App Hosting environment variables.
